# Eigenvalue decomposition of peaks.
# Start with two organ pipes playing distinct tones. One pipe's fundamental is very close to some overtone of the other pipe.
# We identify all relevant peaks, using Newton's method with DFTs to accurately find peaks in frequency space.
# Each peak attests to one fundamental, but if there are very slight tuning errors, then they may appear to be a single peak.
# But we can infer the frequency of each fundamental by looking at the ensemble and using linear algebra, or non-negative matrix factorization some optimization method.
# We assume that the frequencies are mathematically almost perfect.
# There will be small errors, but we should be able to determine the fundamental of each pipe. 





# Fix rendering scales and bounds



# Do time domain tracking
# Use Newton's method in the frequency domain to find peaks

# Tuning stuff: Temperament, partials, note names, buttons, state storage, 
# Watch integration
